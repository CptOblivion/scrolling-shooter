# Untitled Scrolling Shmup Game
### A simple retro-styled scrolling shooter, with a level editor
Unity 2020.2.1f1

Visually styled like a pixel-art shmup (inspired by the likes of Raptor and Tyrian); the art is modeled in 3d and rendered in real-time, but with strict adherence to positioning on the pixel grid and rotating in increments, the appearance of 2d sprites is created with a much more rapid iteration time. Coloring is achieved primarily with vertex colors, to bypass the requirement to set up UV maps, textures, and materials.
